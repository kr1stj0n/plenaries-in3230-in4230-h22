# 2nd Plenary (IN3230/4230) - UNIX sockets

In this session, we're going to implement a client/server application that uses
UNIX sockets.

## Usage

- Compile the program using `make all` in the main directory.
- `./chat -s` to run the server and `./chat -c` to connect as a client.
- Follow the on-screen instructions
- Practise and implement new features.

Good luck! :-)
