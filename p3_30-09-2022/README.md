# 3rd plenary session: 30.09.2022 #

This plenary session was entirely focused on RAW sockets and MIP-ARP protocol.
Through a simple example of a 3-node topology (A - B - C), we covered the main
functions that a node needs to call in order to:

	- send a simple ARP request via a RAW socket
	- send a ARP reply in response to a BROADCAST ARP request
	- walk through all the interfaces of a node and store their MAC addreses
	- etc.

Enough with words and hands on the C code!  

Check the code
[here](https://github.com/kr1stj0n/plenaries-in3230-in4230-h22/tree/main/p3_30-09-2022/greet_ur_neighbor)
and feel free to adapt it for the Home Exams.  

**NOTE:** These examples that we are coding in the plenaries are very simple.
Make sure to write clean and efficient code in C, with proper functions and
better comments.  

Good luck! :-)
