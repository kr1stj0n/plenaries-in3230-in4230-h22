# 5th plenary session: 14.10.2022 #

In this session we focused on the Linux kernel implentations of Ethernet and
ARP protocols, which are two protocols that we are using in our MIP network
stack.  

[Here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) you may find the Linux kernel source
tree.  

[This](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ethernet/eth.c) file
contains the main implementation of Ethernet, whereas the ARP code can be found
[here.](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/arp.c)  

Consider browsing the mighty Linux kernel source tree to check other protocols
of the TCP/IP stack.  

Have fun! :-)
